      For this lab, I used several web accessibility evaluation tools to see how
      accessible my midterm website was. In testing my website, I found two main
      problems with my site.
    </h3>
    <h3 class="lab06-description">
      First, the header nesting patterns in my website do not follow the web
      accessibility guidelines. Only &lth1&gt and &lth2&gt header tags should
      follow an &lth1&gt tag, but I only use &lth1&gt and &lth3&gt tags
      throughout my site; I skipped over the &lth2&gt tag. To fix this, I would
      change all the &lth3&gt tags to &lth2&gt tags so that the header levels
      follow the accessibility guidelines.
    </h3>
    <h3 class="lab06-description">
      Second, my midterm website does not have any page regions or ARIA
      landmarks. Web pages should have regions defined, especially for the main
      content, but I mostly only used &ltdiv&gt tags. To fix this, I would make
      the HTML tags on my pages more specific. For example, I would add a
      &ltmav&gt tag to my navigation links. I would also add &ltmain&gt tags to
      the main content area of each page.
    </h3>
    <h3 class="lab06-description">
      As I build the website for my final project, I will keep these ideas in
      mind and focus more on building an accessible website. I will also
      regularly check it to ensure that the website follows the accessibility
      guidelines.
