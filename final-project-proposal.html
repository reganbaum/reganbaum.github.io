      <h3 class="fpp-description fpp-subtopic">What and Why:</h3>
      <h3 class="fpp-content">
        For my final project, I will build a website that showcases my
        experience with Literacy Through Photography (LTP). LTP is a
        student-centered teaching methodology that focuses on participation
        creativity, and critical thinking. I was first introduced to LTP the
        summer after my first year of college, when I participated in DukeEngage
        – Tanzania LTP. Through that program, I taught LTP lessons in more than
        ten schools in Tanzania. This semester, I have taught LTP lessons in two
        schools in Durham. I want to build a website about my experiences with
        LTP because I am passionate about this teaching methodology, and it has
        taught me a lot. I want to share with other people what LTP is and how
        it can be used in classrooms.

        <h3 class="fpp-description fpp-subtopic">Target Audience:</h3>
        <h3 class="fpp-content">
          My target audience will be teachers and students, as well as anyone
          interested in learning more about LTP. As I mentioned, LTP goes beyond
          textbook knowledge and allows students to practice collaboration,
          critical thinking, and other soft skills that are important in any
          career.

        <h3 class="fpp-content">
          By visiting this site, viewers will learn about what LTP is, various
          LTP activities, and the benefits of LTP both in and out of the
          classroom.

      <h3 class="fpp-content">
        Past DukeEngage students have created a

          href="https://literacythroughphotography.wordpress.com/"
          target="_blank"
          >WordPress site</a
        >
        that showcases blogs written by LTP students. Duke’s Center for
        Documentary Studies also has a
        <a
          href="https://documentarystudies.duke.edu/literacy-through-photography"

          target="_blank"
          >page</a
        >
        that explains LTP. I plan to draw inspiration for content from these
        sites to explain what LTP is and how to do some of the most popular LTP
        projects.

        <h3 class="fpp-description fpp-subtopic">Organization and Design:</h3>
        <h3 class="fpp-content">
          I like the navigation and layout of

            >this website</a
          >
          because it conveys a lot with minimal words. Also, the simplicity
          makes the user flow easy to understand. I will look to this website
          for inspiration on the organization and design for my website. I plan
          to use a similar style of having a photo with a transparent button
          over it on the LTP home page.

        <h3 class="fpp-content">
          To enhance the user experience of my website, I will attempt to shrink
          the photos as the user scrolls, similar to how
          <a

            >this website</a

          does. This will draw attention to the photo, while also allowing the
          viewer to focus on the content of the lessons. Shrinking the photo
          allows for the shift in attention.

          photos/videos I can use for this site. THe professor has a collection
          of over 20 years of LTP work, and I would love to include some of the
          older work as well.

          be able to contribute to the project in some manner, and the website
          would showcase everyone's contribution to the project. Another reach
          goal I have for this project is to add a game or visualization of some
          sort that explains at least one of the projects further.
