        My story begins in Ohio. Born and raised, I could not wait to escape
        the Midwest. When college came, I went off to North Carolina. While in
        college, I had the opportunity to travel to Tanzania, where I learned
        more about participatory learning. Then, I made it to Australia, where
        I discovered my passion for designing and developing simple user
        experiences. Before coming back to North Carolina, I made a stop in
        Silicon Valley to explore the tech scene on the West Coast.

      <h3 class="about-text">
        Two years of traveling around the world has taught me a lot about
        myself and the world. I have gained an appreciation for Ohio and where
        I come from. I have discovered new cultures, ideas, and passions, but
        I still have so much left to discover. I can't wait to see where my
        next adventure takes me.
